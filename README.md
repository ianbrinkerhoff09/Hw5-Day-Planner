HOW IT WORKS:
The page has 9 rows for each corresponding hour in a 9:00-5:00 hours stretch. There are textareas in each row that allow the user
to input whatever they so choose. They can then save their inputs by clicking the calendar button to the right of the textarea. This
will allow the user to save their inputs to local storage and retain their inputs even if they leave the page.

The current date is displayed at the top of the page and is maintained by moment.js. Additionally textareas will change color depending
on if the corresponding hour is past, present, or future. This is also maintained by moment.js.
